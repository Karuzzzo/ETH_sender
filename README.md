# ETH_sender
This code implements simple working environment for ethereum wallet. It can only send transactions in testnet Rinkeby. 
Private key is already written inside this code, so code will work only with my own wallet.

# Usage

To install this code, just download it, unpack and run 
```
python main.py
```
Then you will be asked to input wallet, where you want to send your(mine, actually) ethereum. 
After, type in integer amount of ethereum to send.

In output, my program will print JSON transaction, and also sends it to testnet Rinkeby.
